# Restaurant Quiz
In CPSC 210, we coded in small parts of a game called "Restaurant Quiz" for Android. This is a full port of that game to iOS using Swift, without using any of the previous code for reference.

Some liberties have been taken along the way, primarily towards the UI and a few game elements.

This version utilizes many features and technologies of iOS, including:

* Storyboards
* Auto Layout
* UI animations
* MapKit
* Dynamic Text
* Archiving

* "Scores button", created by Mundo from the Noun Project
* Yelp, for their search API
