# Restaurant Quiz
We coded in small parts of a game called "Restaurant Quiz" for Android in CPSC 210. This is a full port to iOS using Swift, using none of the old code for reference.

Some liberties have been taken along the way, primarily towards the UI and a few game elements.

This version utilizes many features of iOS, including:
* Auto Layout
* UI animations
* MapKit

Credits:
* "Scores button", created by Mundo from the Noun Project
* Yelp, for their search API
